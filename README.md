# Home Sales

## Project Description
This project leverages SparkSQL to analyze and extract key insights from home sales data. The analysis involved several key steps:

- **Creating Temporary Views**: Facilitating easier and more efficient querying of the dataset.
- **Data Partitioning**: Enhancing performance by organizing the data into partitions.
- **Caching and Uncaching Temporary Tables**: Improving the speed of repeated queries by caching tables and then freeing up memory by uncaching.
- **Ensuring Uncaching**: Confirming that the tables were successfully removed from the cache.

Using SparkSQL allows for efficient management and querying of large datasets, making it an effective tool for home sales data analysis.
